# HTML2TEI

Map the HTML schema of portals to valid [TEI XML](https://tei-c.org/) with the tags and structures used in them using
 small manual portal-specific configurations.

The portal-specific configuration is created manually with the help of three different tools which aid evaluating
 the inventory of the tags and structures used in the HTML code. The manual evaluation of such structures
 enables one to create a valid TEI XML from the HTML source keeping all desired (text) schema elements
 in a fine-grained way carefully supervised by the user. In addition to converting the article body,
 the metadata can be converted to the [Schema.org](https://schema.org/) standard.

The conversion process is automatic and scales well on large portals with the same schema

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- For Newspaper3k, the installation of the following packages must precede the installation of this program:
  `python3-dev libxml2-dev libxslt-dev libjpeg-dev zlib1g-dev libpng12-dev`

## Install

### pip

`pip3 install html2tei`

### Manual

1. `git clone https://github.com/ELTE-DH/HTML2TEI.git`
2. Run `python3 setup.py install` (you may have to use `sudo` at the beginning of this command)

## Usage

This program is designed to be used with [WebArticleCurator](https://github.com/elte-dh/WebArticleCurator/).
The article WARC files should be placed in a directory (`warc-dir`) and a configuration YAML must
 map the WARC files to the specific portal configuration.
The program can be run from command line or from the Python API see the details below 

### Modes

There are five modes of the program:

- Create _HTML Content Tree_ (`content-tree`): Read all the articles to summarize all the structures that occur
  in the portal schema. Finally, the accumulated information represents the tree structure as a nested YAML dictionary
  (for manual inspection)
- The _Tag Inventory Maker_ (`inventory-maker`): Create the tag tables from the articles with their
  gathered information (it will be the basis for manual configuration of renaming)
- The _Tag Bigrams Maker_ (`bigram-maker`): Create the bigram tag table from the articles with their
  gathered information (this table is an add-on that can be used to map the schema)
- The _Portal Article Cleaner_ (`cleaner`): Create the TEI XMLs from the site-specific configuration and
  from the tables supplemented with new label names
- _Diff Tag Tables_ (`diff-tables`): Compare and update the generated (and modified) tables if there are new data
  for the same portal

     targeted web crawling. Our corpus contains news portal articles along with their metadata, that can be useful
     for diverse audiences, ranging from digital humanists to NLP users. The method presented in this paper applies
     rule-based components that allow the curation of the text and the metadata content. The curated data can thereon
     serve as a reference for various tasks and measurements. We designed our workflow to encourage modification and
     customisation. Our concept can also be applied to other genres of portals by using the discovered patterns
     in the architecture of the portals. We found that for a systematic creation or extension of a similar corpus,
     our method provides superior accuracy and ease of use compared to The Wayback Machine, while requiring minimal
     manpower and computational resources. Reproducing the corpus is possible if changes are introduced
     to the text-extraction process. The standard TEI format and Schema.org encoded metadata is used
     for the output format, but we stress that placing the corpus in a digital repository system is recommended
     in order to be able to define semantic relations between the segments and to add rich annotation.",
